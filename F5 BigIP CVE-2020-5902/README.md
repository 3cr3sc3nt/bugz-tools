# F5 BigIP Scanner
Scan for F5 BIG-IP servers in a given list and check them against CVE-2020-5902.
But not like other lazy scripts this one scans all domains at the same time using concurrency, finds BigIP servers using fingerprint from [WhatWAF](https://github.com/Ekultek/WhatWaf) and can take specific headers so you can scan virtual hosts for example :smile:

## Usage
```
BigIP_scanner.py [-h] [--headers HEADERS] [-o O] Domains_file

positional arguments:
  Domains_file       File of domains file to work with

optional arguments:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  --headers HEADERS  Headers you want to add to requests(ex: 'Host: 127.0.0.1')
  -o O               Output the vulnerable domains to a file.
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
