# F5 BigIP Scanner
Scan for F5 BIG-IP servers in a given list and check them against CVE-2020-5902.

But not like other lazy scripts this one scans all domains at the same time using concurrency, finds BigIP servers by fingerprinting the title and favicon and can take specific headers so you can deepin your scan :smile:
